# TODO: Fix Header Username Display in Student Dashboard

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Modify login.php to return JSON response for student login, including full_name, email, phone, profile_photo, and id.
- [ ] Update login.js to parse the JSON response from login.php and set sessionStorage with the user data for students.
- [ ] Verify that student_dashboard.html now displays the correct user name in the header instead of 'student'.
